            <h1>How to play hex?</h1>
            <p>Hex is a 2 player game where the objective is to build a line that connects the two sides of the board<br>
            Each player is assigned a color and will place their pieces on the board so to connect the two sides with its color<br>
            (ie. if you are the red player, your goal is to connect the two red sides of the board)<br>
            Every turn you get to place a piece until one of the players wins! <br>
            Good Luck!</p>
